  // NOTE: I didn't include the use of parameters or loops in either the lobby code or the game code. I felt as this was unnessasary for my needs, since I could just use global variables and calling different loops in specific orders to bypass the need for either of those Javascript abilities. Even if I wanted to, I think it would still be more efficient/intuitive to do it the way I have done it above.
